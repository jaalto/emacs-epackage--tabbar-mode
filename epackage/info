Description: mode to display a tab bar in the header line
 A minor mode to display a tab bar in the header line. You can
 use the mouse to click on a tab and select it. Also, three buttons
 are displayed on the left side of the tab bar in this order: the
 "home", "scroll left", and "scroll right" buttons. The "home" button
 is a general purpose button used to change something on the tab bar.
 The scroll left and scroll right buttons are used to scroll tabs
 horizontally. Tabs can be divided up into groups to maintain several
 sets of tabs at the same time (see also the chapter "Core" below for
 more details on tab grouping). Only one group is displayed on the tab
 bar, and the "home" button, for example, can be used to navigate
 through the different groups, to show different tab bars.
 .

 .
    M-x tabbar-mode		Global minor mode
